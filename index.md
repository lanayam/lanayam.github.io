## CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 was one of my favorites because we used loops to form a pattern. By using inner and outer loops, it was a bit confusing but once finished it made sense, I liked that it was decrementing with each line.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1 was one of my favorite activities because it was the one of the first times we read from a file, we had to open the file before reading what was in it. Also when extracting a line of text by using std::getline().

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 2 was interesting since 2D vectors were used for storing and returning the information called. Also how several files were used, one for functions and the other for the main program.
